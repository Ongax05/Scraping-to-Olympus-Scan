# Olympus Web Scraping Tool

This application is designed to simplify the process of obtaining content from Olympus scan, a platform located at [Olympus](https://olympusv2.gg). The tool takes a chapter URL from Olympus, converts it into a PDF file, and conveniently prompts you to proceed to the next chapter.

## How it Works

1. **Input**: Provide the URL of the Olympus chapter you wish to extract content from.
2. **Output**: Receive a PDF file containing the content of the specified chapter.
3. **Prompt for Next Chapter**: After generating the PDF, the tool will inquire if you want to proceed to the next chapter.
*Next Chapter Prompt**: Choose whether to continue to the next chapter or conclude the process.

This was my first foray into web scraping, and any mistakes I made are likely to be common. Have fun! <3
